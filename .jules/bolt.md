**Learning:** `processChromaKey` is a hot path for image processing. Using `Uint32Array` instead of standard RGBA loop improves processing speed significantly in JS Canvas element. It handles big vs little endian correctly to not break tests. In addition, Promise.all can be used for drawing non-interfering layers in `composeSurfaceElements`.
**Action:** Always prefer `Uint32Array` when processing image data channel iteration in HTML5 Canvas Context. Use concurrent fetches when appropriate.
